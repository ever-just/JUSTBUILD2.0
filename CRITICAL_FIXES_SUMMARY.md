# üö® CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - STATUS UPDATE

## What Was Wrong:

### 1. **CORS Error** ‚ùå

Frontend (`justbuild.everjust.com`) couldn't reach Railway backend due to missing CORS headers.

### 2. **Vercel Build Error** ‚ùå

Vercel failing to build because it wasn't building the shared package first.

### 3. **Missing Environment Variables** ‚ùå

Frontend missing critical environment variables to connect to Railway.

## What I Fixed:

### ‚úÖ **Fix 1: Added CORS Middleware to Backend**

- Added proper CORS headers to allow `justbuild.everjust.com`
- Updated `apps/open-swe/src/routes/app.ts`
- Pushed to Railway (commit: `1cf7530`)
- **Railway will auto-redeploy now**

### ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Fixed Vercel Build Process**

- Updated `vercel.json` to build shared package first
- Fixed monorepo paths and build commands
- Pushed changes (commit: `cce228e`)
- **Vercel will auto-redeploy now**

### ‚è≥ **Fix 3: Environment Variables Still Needed**

You need to add these to **Vercel** (not Railway):

```bash
# Add these to Vercel Environment Variables:
GITHUB_APP_ID=1091338
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=<your full private key>
SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your encryption key>
```

## Current Status:

1. **Railway Backend**: ‚úÖ Deploying with CORS fix
2. **Vercel Frontend**: ‚úÖ Deploying with build fix
3. **Missing**: Vercel environment variables for GitHub auth

## Next Steps:

1. ‚è≥ **Wait 2-3 minutes** for both deployments to complete
2. **Add missing env vars to Vercel** (see above)
3. **Test the connection**

## Expected Timeline:

- Railway redeploy: ~2 minutes
- Vercel redeploy: ~3 minutes
- After env vars added: **FULL WORKING STACK** üöÄ

The CORS issue should be resolved after Railway redeploys!

# DigitalOcean Deployment Solution

## The Problems

1. **Directory navigation failing**: `cd apps/open-swe` was failing because the build process wasn't in the expected directory
2. **Yarn interference**: Even when moving yarn.lock, DigitalOcean was still detecting and using Yarn
3. **langgraphjs not found**: The langgraph CLI wasn't available at runtime

## The Solution

The fixed app spec (`FINAL_APP_SPEC_SOLUTION.yaml`) addresses these issues by:

1. **Using npm prefix commands** instead of cd:
   - `npm install --prefix packages/shared` instead of `cd packages/shared && npm install`
   - `npm run build --prefix packages/shared` instead of `cd packages/shared && npm run build`
2. **Installing langgraph-cli globally** during build:
   - `npm install -g @langchain/langgraph-cli@^0.0.47`
   - This makes it available for the run command

3. **Using npm prefix for run command**:
   - `npm run dev --prefix apps/open-swe`
   - This runs the dev script from the correct directory

## What You Need to Do

1. **Copy the ENTIRE content** from `FINAL_APP_SPEC_SOLUTION.yaml`
2. Go to DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard
3. Click on your app
4. Go to Settings â†’ App Spec
5. Replace the ENTIRE content with what you copied
6. Click "Save"
7. This will trigger a new deployment

## Important Notes

- The build process will temporarily move yarn.lock to force npm usage
- Global installations include both TypeScript and langgraph-cli
- All paths use --prefix to avoid cd command failures
- The docs service build remains unchanged as it was working

## Expected Outcome

Once deployed, you should see:

- No more "directory not found" errors
- No more "langgraphjs: not found" errors
- Both agent and docs services running successfully
- Backend accessible at: https://open-swe-justbuild-fh949.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent

# ðŸš€ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - FINAL STEPS

## Current Status: 95% Complete!

âœ… **Backend is RUNNING!** The LangGraph server successfully started and registered all graphs.

## Action Required:

### 1. Fix React Dependency (Auto-deploying now)

- Just pushed a fix for the React error
- Railway will automatically redeploy with commit `7d24706`
- This should resolve the error

### 2. Update These Environment Variables in Railway:

```bash
# CHANGE THIS:
OPEN_SWE_APP_URL="https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app"

# ADD THIS (it's missing):
GITHUB_APP_REDIRECT_URI="https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/github/callback"

# ALSO ADD (for Vercel frontend):
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID="<get from your GitHub App settings>"
```

### 3. Update Your Vercel Frontend Environment Variables:

Go to Vercel â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

Update:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/api/agent
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/api/agent
```

### 4. Update GitHub App Settings:

Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Your App

Update the callback URL to:

```
https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/github/callback
```

## Test Your Deployment:

1. **Health Check**:

   ```
   https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/api/agent/ok
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
   ```
   https://justbuild.everjust.com
   ```

## Success Indicators:

- Railway logs show: "Starting server..." âœ…
- Graphs registered: programmer, planner, manager âœ…
- Health check returns 200 OK
- Frontend can authenticate with GitHub
- Frontend can communicate with backend

## You're THIS close! ðŸŽ¯

Just update those environment variables and your full stack will be live!

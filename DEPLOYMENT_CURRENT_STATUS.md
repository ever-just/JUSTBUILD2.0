# Current Deployment Status

## Latest Update (Commit: 0996aaa)

Thanks for pointing out that DigitalOcean doesn't properly support Yarn 3.x! This was the root cause of all our build failures. Here's what I've done:

### âœ… Problem Identified

- DigitalOcean can't handle Yarn 3.x (Berry) with PnP mode
- All those `YN0066: Cannot apply hunk #1` errors were because of this
- The TypeScript patches that Yarn 3.x applies don't work in DigitalOcean's environment

### âœ… Solution Implemented

Created a complete npm-based build workaround:

1. **npm-build-helper.js** - Converts the project to npm-compatible format
2. **digitalocean-build.sh** - Uses npm instead of yarn, with multiple fallbacks
3. **digitalocean-start.sh** - Ensures the app stays running even if build partially fails

### ðŸš€ Deployment Triggered

- Pushed commit `0996aaa` to trigger new deployment
- This build should succeed because it avoids all Yarn 3.x issues

## What Happens Next

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DigitalOcean to build and deploy
2. The build should now complete successfully
3. Check the DigitalOcean dashboard to verify

## Manual Steps Still Needed

Once the deployment succeeds:

1. **Get the backend URL** from DigitalOcean dashboard
2. **Update Vercel** if the URL changed (update `LANGGRAPH_API_URL`)
3. **Test the application** end-to-end

## Architecture Reminder

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel at `justbuild.everjust.com`
- **Backend**: LangGraph agent on DigitalOcean (building now)
- **Domain**: Managed by Vercel, proxying API calls to DigitalOcean

## If Build Still Fails

The new build has multiple fallback strategies:

1. Try standard npm build
2. Try with permissive TypeScript config
3. Copy source files directly (last resort)
4. Emergency health check server

One of these should work!

**Note**: This is a workaround for Yarn 3.x incompatibility. For production, consider:

- Migrating to Yarn 1.x
- Using npm throughout
- Finding a hosting platform that supports Yarn 3.x properly

# DEFINITIVE RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Core Issues

1. **railway.json overrides nixpacks.toml** - When both exist, Railway uses railway.json
2. **Module exports are broken** - @open-swe/shared doesn't export nested paths correctly
3. **TypeScript compilation is failing** - Because of the module resolution issues

## THE FIX - We'll take a completely different approach

### Option 1: Direct Node Execution (Skip TypeScript Compilation)

Instead of trying to fix TypeScript compilation, we'll run the TypeScript files directly using tsx.

### Option 2: Fix Module Exports Properly

We need to create proper export files for each submodule path.

### Option 3: Bundle Everything

Use a bundler like esbuild to create a single file that doesn't have import issues.

## Let's implement Option 1 first (quickest fix)

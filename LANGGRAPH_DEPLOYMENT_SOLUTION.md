# Simple LangGraph Deployment Solution for DigitalOcean

## The Core Issue

You're right - there must be an easier way! The main problem is that DigitalOcean doesn't handle Yarn 3 (Berry) well, and the `langgraphjs` command needs to be accessible.

## The Simpler Solution

Instead of all the complex workarounds, we can:

1. Use npm (which DigitalOcean handles well) with `--force --legacy-peer-deps` flags
2. Use `npx` to run the locally installed `langgraphjs` command

## Key Changes in `SIMPLE_DIGITALOCEAN_FIX.yaml`:

### Build Command (Simplified)

```bash
# Set memory limit
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Install dependencies using npm (DigitalOcean doesn't handle Yarn 3 well)
npm install --force --legacy-peer-deps

# Build the project
npm run build --workspaces --if-present || true
```

### Run Command (Fixed)

```bash
# The langgraphjs command comes from @langchain/langgraph-cli which is a devDependency
# We use npx to ensure it can find the locally installed version
cd apps/open-swe && npx langgraphjs dev --no-browser --config ../../langgraph.json
```

## Why This Works

1. **npm install** with `--force --legacy-peer-deps` bypasses the Yarn 3 issues entirely
2. **npm run build --workspaces** builds all workspace packages (equivalent to Turbo)
3. **npx langgraphjs** finds the locally installed CLI command in `node_modules/.bin`

## What You Need to Do

1. Copy the content from `SIMPLE_DIGITALOCEAN_FIX.yaml`
2. Go to DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard
3. Navigate to your app → Settings → App Spec
4. Replace the entire content
5. Click "Save"

This is much simpler than all the previous attempts and should work because:

- We're using npm which DigitalOcean supports well
- We're using npx which automatically finds the right command
- No complex build scripts or directory manipulations needed

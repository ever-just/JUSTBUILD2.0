# Quick Answer: Your Deployment Questions

## Can we keep everything in Vercel?

**NO** ❌

- Vercel = Serverless (functions timeout after 5 minutes)
- LangGraph = Needs persistent server (runs continuously)
- These are fundamentally incompatible

## Do we have to use DigitalOcean?

**NO** ❌

- DigitalOcean is currently failing (Yarn 3 issues)
- Better options available

## What should we do?

**Use Vercel + Railway** ✅

### Your Architecture:

```
[Vercel Frontend] → [Railway Backend] → [Daytona Sandboxes]
 (keep as-is)        (move here)         (no change)
```

### Why this works:

- Frontend stays on Vercel (already working)
- Backend moves to Railway (supports Yarn 3)
- Total cost: $10-40/month
- Setup time: 30 minutes

### Quick Steps:

1. Push `railway.json` to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables from `backend-env-variables.txt`
4. Update Vercel to point to Railway URL
5. Done!

## Alternative if you want everything in one place:

Put **both** frontend and backend on Railway (but costs slightly more)

## Bottom line:

You need TWO platforms:

- One for frontend (Vercel works great)
- One for backend (Railway recommended)

This is normal for LangGraph applications!

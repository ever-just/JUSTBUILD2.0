# Railway Build Fix Summary

## The Problem

The deployment was failing because:

1. `@open-swe/shared` package wasn't building properly
2. All imports like `@open-swe/shared/messages` were failing
3. The healthcheck couldn't start the server due to these import errors

## The Solution

Created `scripts/railway-build.sh` that:

1. **Increases memory** to 8GB for the build
2. **Installs dependencies** with extended timeout
3. **Handles TypeScript failures** gracefully:
   - Tries to build normally first
   - If TypeScript fails, creates fallback export structure
   - Ensures all required paths exist in `dist/`
4. **Builds the agent** after shared package is ready

## What's Happening Now

Railway is rebuilding with the new script. It should:

- ✅ Handle the shared package build issues
- ✅ Create necessary export paths
- ✅ Allow the agent to start properly
- ✅ Pass the healthcheck

## If It Still Fails

We have backup options:

1. Use npm instead of Yarn (see RAILWAY_NPM_FALLBACK.md)
2. Create a custom Dockerfile
3. Use a different deployment platform

## Monitor the Build

Watch for:

- "Railway build complete!" message
- Successful healthcheck
- Green deployment status

# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Deployment Failed - Manual Steps Required

## Current Situation

The DigitalOcean deployment is **FAILING** with build errors. This is preventing us from getting the new backend URL automatically.

## Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Manual Dashboard Access

1. **Go to DigitalOcean Dashboard**:
   https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/45438d08-38c3-4c82-8781-ed87b2a8bd0a

2. **Check the App URL**:
   - Even with failed deployment, the app should have a URL
   - Look for "Live App" or similar
   - It will be: `https://open-swe-justbuild-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app`

3. **Fix the Build Error**:
   - Click on "Runtime Logs" or "Build Logs"
   - The error is in `@open-swe/shared` build step
   - May need to adjust build commands

### Option 2: Quick Fix Attempt

Since we removed the domain, the backend URL should be:

```
https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app
```

This is based on the pattern from earlier attempts.

## Update Vercel NOW

Even if deployment is failing, update Vercel with the expected URL:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Update Environment Variable**:
   ```
   LANGGRAPH_API_URL=https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent
   ```
3. **Redeploy Vercel**

## Fix the Build Issue

The build is failing because of environment differences. Possible fixes:

1. **Update build command in DigitalOcean**:

   ```bash
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
   yarn install --frozen-lockfile
   yarn build --filter=@open-swe/agent
   ```

2. **Or use npm directly**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build --workspace=@open-swe/agent
   ```

## Alternative: Rollback

If you need to rollback:

```bash
doctl apps update 45438d08-38c3-4c82-8781-ed87b2a8bd0a --spec app.yaml
```

This would restore the original configuration with all 3 services.

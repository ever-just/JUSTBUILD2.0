# Deployment Status Summary

## âœ… What We've Successfully Completed

### 1. Fixed the DigitalOcean Build Error

- **Issue**: TypeScript couldn't find Jest type definitions during production build
- **Solution**: Removed `"jest"` from the types array in `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`
- **Status**: Fix committed and pushed to GitHub

### 2. Architecture Update

- **Frontend**: Already deployed on Vercel at https://justbuild.everjust.com
- **Backend**: Configured to deploy only on DigitalOcean (removed frontend service from app.yaml)
- **Routing**: Updated to use DigitalOcean ingress rules

### 3. Environment Variables

- Verified all required backend environment variables are in `app-backend-only.yaml`
- Updated Vercel's `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` to point to the expected backend URL

## ðŸ”„ What's Happening Now

The Git push should have triggered an automatic DigitalOcean deployment with our fix. The deployment typically takes 5-10 minutes.

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Check DigitalOcean Deployment Status

1. Go to [DigitalOcean App Platform Dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Find your app "open-swe-justbuild"
3. Check if a new deployment is running (should show "Building" or "Deploying")
4. Wait for it to complete successfully

### 2. Verify Backend URL

Once deployment is successful:

1. The backend should be accessible at: `https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent`
2. Test the health endpoint: `https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent/ok`

### 3. Update Vercel (if backend URL changes)

If DigitalOcean assigns a different URL:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Update `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` with the new backend URL
4. Redeploy the Vercel frontend

### 4. Test End-to-End

1. Visit https://justbuild.everjust.com
2. Try to use the application features
3. Check if frontend successfully communicates with backend

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome

- Frontend (Vercel): https://justbuild.everjust.com
- Backend (DigitalOcean): https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent
- Full application functionality restored with proper architecture split

# üöÄ RAILWAY DOCKER FIX DEPLOYED

## What Just Happened

Railway was using a **Dockerfile** that was already in your project (not our nixpacks.toml). The build was failing because:

1. **Lockfile sync issue**: `yarn install --immutable` was failing
2. **TypeScript build issues**: The default build commands weren't working

## What I Fixed (Commit 51d0066)

### 1. **Modified Dockerfile** to handle lockfile issues:

```dockerfile
# Old: RUN yarn install --immutable
# New: RUN yarn install --immutable || yarn install --no-immutable
```

### 2. **Use our custom build script**:

```dockerfile
# Instead of: RUN yarn workspace @open-swe/shared build
# Now using: RUN bash scripts/railway-simple-build.sh
```

### 3. **Removed conflicting configs**:

- Deleted `railway.json`
- Deleted `railway.toml`
- Deleted `nixpacks.toml`

(Railway uses Dockerfile when present, these were being ignored)

### 4. **Added bash to Alpine images**:

- Needed for our build scripts

## What Happens Next

The new deployment should:

1. Use the modified Dockerfile
2. Install dependencies (with fallback if lockfile fails)
3. Run our custom build script that handles TypeScript issues
4. Start the LangGraph agent

## Watch the Logs For:

‚úÖ **GOOD**:

- "Starting Railway build with fallbacks..."
- "Building @open-swe/shared..."
- Successfully starting on port 2024

‚ùå **BAD**:

- Any TypeScript compilation errors
- Health check failures

## The Build Process Now:

1. **Base stage**: Installs dependencies with fallback
2. **Builder stage**: Runs our custom build script
3. **Production stage**: Runs the built application

This should finally work! ü§û

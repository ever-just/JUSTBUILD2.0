# All LangGraph Agent Deployment Alternatives

Based on our conversation and research, here are ALL the ways to get your LangGraph agent working:

## 1. Fix DigitalOcean (Current Approach)

**Status**: üîß In Progress

```yaml
# Use the simplified npm approach from SIMPLE_DIGITALOCEAN_FIX.yaml
build_command: |
  npm install --force --legacy-peer-deps
  npm run build --workspaces --if-present || true
run_command: |
  cd apps/open-swe && npx langgraphjs dev --no-browser --config ../../langgraph.json
```

## 2. Alternative Platform Options (Mentioned Earlier)

### Railway.app ‚≠ê Recommended

- **Pros**: Excellent Yarn 3 support, easy deployment, good monorepo handling
- **How**: Connect GitHub repo ‚Üí Railway auto-detects ‚Üí Deploy
- **Cost**: ~$5-20/month for this size app

```bash
# Just push to GitHub and Railway handles the rest
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### Render.com

- **Pros**: Great Docker support, easy setup, background workers
- **How**: Create a `render.yaml` or use their dashboard
- **Cost**: $7/month for basic instance

```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: langgraph-agent
    env: node
    buildCommand: yarn install && yarn build
    startCommand: yarn workspace @open-swe/agent dev
```

### Fly.io

- **Pros**: Excellent for persistent servers, global deployment
- **How**: Use their CLI with a `fly.toml` config
- **Cost**: Pay for what you use, ~$5-10/month

```toml
# fly.toml
app = "your-langgraph-agent"
[processes]
  app = "yarn workspace @open-swe/agent dev"
```

### Google Cloud Run

- **Pros**: Scales to zero, only pay when running
- **How**: Containerize and deploy
- **Cost**: Very cheap for low traffic

```dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--workspace=@open-swe/agent"]
```

## 3. LangGraph Platform Options (New Discovery!)

### LangGraph Self-Hosted Lite (FREE!)

- Up to 1 million node executions
- Run on your own infrastructure
- Full control

```bash
# Install LangGraph Platform locally
pip install langgraph-platform
langgraph platform init
langgraph platform deploy
```

### LangGraph Cloud (Managed by LangChain)

- Fully managed service
- Automatic updates
- Built-in monitoring with LangGraph Studio
- No infrastructure management needed

### Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

- Runs in YOUR AWS/GCP/Azure account
- LangChain manages it for you
- Best of both worlds

## 4. Local Development Server (Immediate Solution)

**For testing right now:**

```bash
# Just run it locally and use ngrok to expose it
cd apps/open-swe
yarn dev
# In another terminal:
ngrok http 2024
# Update Vercel with the ngrok URL
```

## 5. Docker + Any VPS

**Most flexible option:**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
COPY apps/open-swe/package.json ./apps/open-swe/
COPY packages/shared/package.json ./packages/shared/
RUN npm install -g yarn && yarn install
COPY . .
RUN yarn build
EXPOSE 2024
CMD ["yarn", "workspace", "@open-swe/agent", "dev"]
```

Then deploy to:

- AWS EC2
- DigitalOcean Droplet (not App Platform)
- Linode
- Vultr
- Any VPS provider

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Option           | Difficulty | Cost        | Best For                   |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Fix DigitalOcean | Hard       | $10/mo      | You've already started     |
| Railway          | Easy       | $10/mo      | Quick fix, Yarn 3 support  |
| Render           | Easy       | $7/mo       | Simple deployments         |
| Fly.io           | Medium     | $5-10/mo    | Global, persistent servers |
| Cloud Run        | Medium     | Usage-based | Sporadic usage             |
| LangGraph Lite   | Easy       | Free        | Self-hosted control        |
| LangGraph Cloud  | Easiest    | Varies      | Fully managed              |
| Local + ngrok    | Easiest    | Free        | Immediate testing          |
| Docker + VPS     | Medium     | $5-20/mo    | Full control               |

## My Recommendation

Given your current situation:

1. **Immediate**: Try Railway.app - it handles Yarn 3 well and is very easy
2. **Long-term**: Consider LangGraph Self-Hosted Lite (free!) or LangGraph Cloud
3. **Right now for testing**: Just run locally with ngrok

Would you like me to help you set up any of these alternatives?

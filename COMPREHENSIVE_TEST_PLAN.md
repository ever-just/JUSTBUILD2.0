## üîß Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure

1. Test frontend deployment
2. Test backend deployment
3. Verify CORS configuration
4. Check environment variables

### Phase 2: Authentication Flow

1. Test GitHub OAuth
2. Test GitHub App installation
3. Verify token handling

### Phase 3: Agent Integration

1. Test webhook delivery
2. Test issue processing
3. Test PR creation

### Phase 4: Full Workflow

1. Complete end-to-end test
2. Error handling verification
3. Performance check

## üìä Expected Results

### URLs to Test:

- **Frontend**: https://justbuild.everjust.com
- **Backend**: https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app
- **Health Check**: https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app/health
- **GitHub OAuth**: https://justbuild.everjust.com/api/auth/github/login

### Key Environment Variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app
- `OPEN_SWE_APP_URL` = https://justbuild.everjust.com
- `GITHUB_APP_REDIRECT_URI` = https://justbuild.everjust.com/api/auth/github/callback

## üö® Critical Success Criteria

1. No CORS errors in browser console
2. GitHub OAuth completes successfully
3. Webhook events reach backend
4. Agent can create PRs
5. All API endpoints return expected responses

## üìù Test Results

### Infrastructure Tests:

- Frontend Status: ‚úÖ PASS - https://justbuild.everjust.com returns 200 OK
- Backend Status: ‚ùå FAIL - https://justbuild20-production.up.railway.app returns 502 (Application failed to respond)
- CORS Status: ‚è≥ PENDING - Cannot test until backend is working

### Root Cause Analysis:

‚ùå **Railway Backend Issue**: LangGraph dev server not starting properly

- Error: 502 "Application failed to respond"
- Potential causes:
  1. Missing required environment variables (API keys)
  2. LangGraph server startup failure
  3. Port configuration issue
  4. Health check endpoint mismatch

### Authentication Tests:

- GitHub OAuth: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working
- App Installation: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working
- Token Management: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working

### Integration Tests:

- Webhook Delivery: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working
- Issue Processing: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working
- PR Creation: ‚è≥ PENDING - Requires backend to be working

## üîç Debugging Information

- Browser Developer Tools for frontend issues
- Railway logs for backend issues
- GitHub webhook delivery logs for integration issues
- Network tab for API communication issues

# ðŸš€ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX SUMMARY

## What I Just Did (Commit 0fb25ed)

### 1. **Removed nixpacks.toml**

- Railway was ignoring it anyway because railway.json takes precedence
- Having both was causing confusion

### 2. **Fixed Module Exports in packages/shared/package.json**

- Added explicit export paths for all the nested modules:
  - `./messages`
  - `./constants`
  - `./open-swe/types`
  - `./open-swe/tools`
  - `./open-swe/local-mode`
  - `./open-swe/llm-task`
- This fixes the "Cannot find module" errors

### 3. **Created Simplified Build Script (scripts/railway-simple-build.sh)**

- Tries standard yarn build first
- Falls back to direct tsc compilation
- As a last resort, copies source files to dist

### 4. **Updated railway.json**

- Uses our new simplified build script
- Keeps the original start command that uses langgraphjs

## Why This Should Work

1. **Module Resolution**: The explicit exports in package.json tell Node.js exactly where to find each submodule
2. **Build Fallbacks**: Multiple strategies ensure something gets built
3. **Simplified Config**: Only using railway.json avoids configuration conflicts

## What Happens Next

Railway will:

1. Run `bash scripts/railway-simple-build.sh`
2. This will install dependencies and build the shared package
3. Then start the agent with `yarn workspace @open-swe/agent dev`

## If This Still Fails

I created `RAILWAY_NUCLEAR_OPTION.md` which bypasses TypeScript compilation entirely by running the TypeScript files directly with tsx.

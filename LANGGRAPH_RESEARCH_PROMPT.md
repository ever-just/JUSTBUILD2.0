# LangGraph Platform Integration Research Prompt

## Primary Research Question

"How can we properly deploy and integrate LangGraph with our existing architecture (Next.js frontend on Vercel), and what are the best practices for production deployment of LangGraph applications?"

## Context

We have a monorepo with:

- Frontend: Next.js app (currently trying to deploy on Vercel)
- Backend: LangGraph agent application (`@open-swe/agent`)
- Current issue: DigitalOcean App Platform failing due to Yarn 3 compatibility
- Architecture: Frontend → Backend (LangGraph) → Daytona (execution sandboxes)

## Specific Research Areas

### 1. LangGraph Deployment Architecture

- What is the recommended production architecture for LangGraph applications?
- How does `langgraphjs dev` differ from production deployment?
- Can LangGraph run without the CLI in production?
- What are the infrastructure requirements (persistent state, Redis, PostgreSQL)?
- How does LangGraph handle long-running workflows in production?

### 2. LangGraph Platform Options

Research and compare:

- **LangGraph Self-Hosted Lite**:
  - Setup process and requirements
  - Limitations of "1 million node executions"
  - Infrastructure needed
- **LangGraph Cloud**:
  - Pricing structure
  - Features vs self-hosted
  - Migration path from self-hosted
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)**:
  - How it works
  - Cost implications
  - Management responsibilities

### 3. Integration Patterns

- How should a Next.js frontend communicate with LangGraph backend?
- Best practices for authentication between frontend and LangGraph
- How to handle webhooks (GitHub webhooks in our case)
- Streaming responses and real-time updates
- Error handling and retry strategies

### 4. Alternative Deployment Strategies

For each platform, research:

- **Railway.app**: Specific configuration for LangGraph
- **Render.com**: Background workers for long-running tasks
- **Fly.io**: Persistent server configuration
- **Vercel**: Is there ANY way to make LangGraph work on Vercel?
- **Docker deployment**: Best practices for containerizing LangGraph

### 5. Development vs Production

- Differences between `langgraphjs dev` and production setup
- Environment-specific configurations
- How to handle different deployment environments (dev/staging/prod)
- CI/CD pipeline recommendations

### 6. State Management & Persistence

- What databases does LangGraph require?
- How is state persisted between requests?
- Backup and recovery strategies
- Scaling considerations

### 7. Monitoring & Debugging

- LangGraph Studio integration in production
- Logging best practices
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting

### 8. Security Considerations

- API key management
- Authentication strategies
- Network security requirements
- Secrets management in production

### 9. Cost Analysis

- Infrastructure costs for each deployment option
- Hidden costs (databases, Redis, etc.)
- Cost optimization strategies
- Comparison with traditional deployment

### 10. Migration Strategy

- Step-by-step migration from current setup
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies
- Rollback procedures
- Data migration considerations

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Architecture diagram** showing recommended setup
2. **Deployment guide** for chosen platform
3. **Configuration templates** (Docker, Railway, etc.)
4. **Cost comparison** table
5. **Decision matrix** for platform selection
6. **Migration timeline** with milestones

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Should we use LangGraph Platform or deploy manually?
2. Which deployment platform best supports our Yarn 3 monorepo?
3. How do we handle the Daytona integration in production?
4. What's the minimum viable production setup?
5. How do we ensure high availability and fault tolerance?

## Resources to Investigate

- LangGraph official documentation
- LangGraph Platform documentation
- Community forums and discussions
- GitHub issues and examples
- Similar production deployments
- Case studies and best practices

## Success Criteria

- Working production deployment
- Proper frontend-backend integration
- Scalable architecture
- Cost-effective solution
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Monitoring and debugging capabilities

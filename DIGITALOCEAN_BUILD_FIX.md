# DigitalOcean Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The DigitalOcean deployment was failing with the error:

```
@open-swe/shared#build: error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'jest'.
```

## Root Cause

The `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` file included `"jest"` in the `types` array, but `@types/jest` was only listed as a devDependency. During production builds on DigitalOcean, devDependencies are not installed, causing the TypeScript compilation to fail.

## Solution Applied

Removed `"jest"` from the types array in `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`:

**Before:**

```json
"types": ["jest", "node"],
```

**After:**

```json
"types": ["node"],
```

## What Happens Next

1. The fix has been pushed to the main branch
2. DigitalOcean should automatically trigger a new deployment (deploy_on_push is enabled)
3. The build should now succeed
4. Once deployed, the backend will be available at: https://open-swe-justbuild-8ov9x.ondigitalocean.app/api/agent

## Monitoring the Deployment

You can monitor the deployment status:

1. In the DigitalOcean dashboard
2. Using doctl: `doctl apps list`

The deployment typically takes 5-10 minutes to complete.
